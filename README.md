## Hello_CircuitPython

### Description & Code
The goal of this asignment was to make the Led change colors  

```python
import board
import neopixel
import time

dot = neopixel.NeoPixel(board.NEOPIXEL, 1)  # attach MetroExpress and led
dot.brightness = 0.2

print("make it rainbow!")

while True:  # makes the led change colours using colour codes 
    dot.fill((255, 0, 0))  # red
    time.sleep(0.5)
    dot.fill((255, 128, 0))  # orange
    time.sleep(0.5)
    dot.fill((255, 255, 0))  # yellow
    time.sleep(0.5)
    dot.fill((0, 255, 0))  # green
    time.sleep(0.5)
    dot.fill((0, 0, 255))  # blue
    time.sleep(0.5)
    dot.fill((255, 0, 255))  # purple
    time.sleep(0.5)

```

### Wiring
There is no code required for this assignment 
Make an account with your google ID at [tinkercad.com](https://www.tinkercad.com/learn/circuits), and use "TinkerCad Circuits to make a wiring diagram."  It's really easy!  
Then post an image here.   [here's a quick tutorial for all markdown code, like making links](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

### Reflection
I had no real problems with this asignment. It helped me understand how to use circuitpython and how it worked.




## CircuitPython_Servo

### Description & Code
The goal of this assignment was to control a servo using 2 buttons

from curses import BUTTON1_PRESSED
import time
from tkinter import Button
import board
import pwmio
from adafruit_motor import servo

# create a PWMOut object on Pin A2.
pwm = pwmio.PWMOut(board.D2, duty_cycle=2 ** 15, frequency=50)

# Create a servo object, my_servo.
my_servo = servo.Servo(pwm)

while True:
    
    for angle in range(0, 180, 5):  # 0 - 180 degrees, 5 degrees at a time.
        my_servo.angle = angle 
        time.sleep(0.05)


    for angle in range(180, 0, -5): # 180 - 0 degrees, 5 degrees at a time.
        my_servo.angle = angle
        time.sleep(0.05) 
```

### Reflection
This assignment was more challenging. At first, I had to get one button to controll the servo and then after add and wire the other one.



## CircuitPython_distancesensor
Credit of this whole assignment goes to [Gaby D](https://github.com/gdaless20/Circuitpython))
### Description & Code
 The goal of this assignment was to use a ultrasonic sensor to control the built in LED in the Metro m4.

```python
import time
import board
import adafruit_hcsr04
import neopixel
import simpleio

sonar = adafruit_hcsr04.HCSR04(trigger_pin=board.D5, echo_pin=board.D6)
dot = neopixel.NeoPixel(board.NEOPIXEL, 10, brightness=0.5)

r = 0
g = 0
b = 0


while True:

    try:
        distance = sonar.distance
        print((distance,))

        if distance < 5:
            r = 255
            g = 0
            b = 0
        elif distance > 5 and distance < 20:
            r = simpleio.map_range(distance, 5, 20, 255, 0)
            b = simpleio.map_range(distance, 5, 20, 0, 255)
            g = 0
            r = int(r)
            g = int(g)
            b = int(b)
        elif distance > 20 and distance < 35:
            r = 0
            b = simpleio.map_range(distance, 20, 35, 255, 0)
            g = simpleio.map_range(distance, 20, 35, 0, 255)
            r = int(r)
            g = int(g)
            b = int(b)
        elif distance > 35:
            r = 0
            b = 0
            g = 255
            r = int(r)
            g = int(g)
            b = int(b)
        print(r, g, b)
        time.sleep(0.05)

    except RuntimeError:
        print("Retrying!")
        r = 0
        g = 0
        b = 255
        time.sleep(0.1)

    print(r, g, b)
    dot.fill((r, g, b))
    time.sleep(0.05)
```

### Reflection

I copied this whole assignment from gaby(thanks) but the only problem I had was I had to move 2 files into my lib folder to get it to work.
